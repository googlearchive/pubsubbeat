################### Pubsubbeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Pubsubbeat ######################################

pubsubbeat:
  # The service account or refresh token JSON credentials file to use
  # to authenticate API calls.
  #
  # If you don't specify a credentials file, this Beat will use a
  # strategy called Application Default Credentials (ADC) to find your
  # application's credentials. If your Beat runs on Google Cloud Platform,
  # this strategy is recommended.
  #
  # To learn more about ADC:
  # - https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production
  credentials_file:

  # The GCP project ID with your Pub/Sub topic
  project_id: my-gcp-project

  # The Pub/Sub topic name. You must first create this topic.
  topic: my-topic

  # The Pub/Sub subscription name.
  subscription.name: my-subscription

  # Attempt to create the subscription.
  subscription.create: true # Defaults to true

  # The settings below are used only if the Beat creates the subscription.

  # Whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true, acknowledged messages
  # will not be expunged until they fall out of the RetentionDuration window.
  subscription.retain_acked_messages: false

  # How long to retain messages in backlog, from the time of publish. If
  # retain_acked_messages is true, this duration affects the retention of
  # acknowledged messages, otherwise only unacknowledged messages are retained.
  # Cannot be longer than 7 days or shorter than 10 minutes.
  # Valid time units are "m" and "h". You can also compose them: "2h30m".
  subscription.retention_duration: 168h # Defaults to 7 days

  ### JSON Configuration

  # Whether to decode the Pub/Sub message as a JSON message.
  # If the message is decoded successfully, a "json" field is added to the event with
  # the decoded json object. If the decoding fails, the "message" field includes the
  # plain text message payload.
  json.enabled: false

  # If this setting is enabled, Pubsubbeat adds a "error.message" and "error.key: json" key
  # in case of JSON unmarshaling errors or when a text key is defined in the configuration
  # but cannot be used.
  json.add_error_key: false
